      <div class="container-fluid p-5">
        <p style="color: gray;">Domains and hosting are essential components of the online ecosystem. A domain
           name serves as the user-friendly address for websites, enabling easy access through memorable names 
           instead of complex IP addresses. Domain registrars manage the registration and configuration of these 
           names. On the other hand, web hosting is the service that provides the infrastructure for storing and
           serving website content. It ensures that websites are accessible 24/7 by housing website files, databases,
            and other resources on servers connected to the internet. Different types of hosting, such as shared,
             VPS, dedicated, and cloud hosting, offer various levels of performance and control. Domain hosting 
             involves linking domain names to specific hosting servers, allowing users to reach websites by typing 
             in the domain name in a web browser, initiating the retrieval of web content from the hosting server.
              Together,
           domains and hosting are the foundation of the web, making websites and online services globally accessible. </div>
